         Welcome to the Schedule-Checker tool.
         
         You can check whether your schedule is valid and how well it performs.
         1. First, you upload your schedule on the upload page.
         2. Then, you can check if your schedule has any errors on the Error Check page.
         3. You can also check how well the schedule performs on the KPI page.
         4. Finally, the Gantt chart page gives a visual overview for the schedule of each bus. 
         
         You can navigate to different pages by using the sidebar on your left hand side.
